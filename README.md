# NodeJS-Server
My NodeJS server

    It's MY NodeJS server, not ur, IT'S MINE. 
    IF U'LL TRY TO COPY / STEAL or USE IT, I'LL say some bad words abt u somewhere in the internet (maybe in my frieds' DMs)
    DONT LOOK AT MY NODE JS SERVER!
    IF U READ THAT ALL AND DECIDE TO OPEN SERVER FILE, U MUST KNOW, THAT'S U ARE A ASSHOLE!
    COPYPASTE = DUMBASS
